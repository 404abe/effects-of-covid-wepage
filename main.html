        Caught a vibe
        Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
        I just wanna look into your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
        I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
        When we take a drive
        Maybe we can hit the 405
        Hypnotized by the lights
        Man, this must be the life
        When I go to sleep
        I can't even fall asleep
        Something's got ahold of me
        Feel it taking over me
        But when I'm older, I'll be moving onward
        I just got a drunk text
